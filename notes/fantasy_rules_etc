You pick a team of 21 players. Your starting 13 is broken into positions like a real league team:
- 1 hooker
- 2 front rowers
- 3 back rowers
- 2 halves
- 2 centres
- 3 wingers/fullbacks
Then you have four players on your interchange bench who also score points, and another four ’emergency’ players that don’t score points for your weekly total, but still make/lose money each week. These emergency players will also be counted as playing if there is a last minute change/injury and one of your players doesn’t play the game.
